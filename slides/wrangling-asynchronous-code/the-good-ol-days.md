###  Back in the Day

- Originally computers were big mainframes
- Many users (100s) / one big computer
- Computers more expensive than labour
	- Could train people to use a horrible CLI system
	- No personal computers/public use
- Programming was synchronous
	- Cooperative concurrency
	- Program would pause when it was waiting for something (IO) which would let one of the other user's programs run
